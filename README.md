# Evil-Hangman
Spinoff of popular hangman game where players guess one character at a time until either they are able to guess the target word or phrase or they run out
of the alotted guesses. This variation of the game features a twist. The HangmanManager class does not initially select a target word at the start of the 
game, and instead continually changes the set of possible target words based on the characters the user has guessed so far. The program will select the 
largest possible set of words available in order to make it nearly impossible for the user to win.
